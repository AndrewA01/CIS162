        <p> Hi my name is Andrew, and I recently graduated from CSULB. This is my second time here, I did 2 years at Cerritos College and transferred to CSULB for my last 2 years. While at Long Beach I found out about the field of human factors in psychology, and I have been very interested ever since. For those who dont know what human factors is, it is basically studying human behavior and performance whenever it is interacting and using technology, so a lot of cognitive psychology and engineering courses and knowledge are required. I am really glad that I was able to take this course online because it is much more flexible for me and it is also very useful to my career goals, previously I have done usability testing and accesibility reviews for websites, so this course kind of gives me the insight I need for to  know whats going on behind a webpage. </p>
